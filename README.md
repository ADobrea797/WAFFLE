**Full assembly instructions can be found in the 'Waffle - Assembly Information.pdf' above.**

**SAFETY WARNING**
The mp-6 micropump operates at high voltage which can pose a serious threat to life. The same applies to the valves which require high current to open. Extreme caution must be exercised when handling those components and their drivers. Please read through the safety datasheets of these components before attempting to build and operate this system on your own.
